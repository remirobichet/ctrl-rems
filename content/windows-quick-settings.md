title: Windows quick settings
category: windows
keys: ['Windows', 'a']

This shortcut opens the Quick Settings panel in Windows 10 and Windows 11.

This panel provides quick access to settings like:

- Wi-Fi
- Bluetooth
- Brightness
- Volume
- Focus Assist
- Airplane Mode

Itâ€™s useful for making quick adjustments without opening the full Settings app.

I often use this shortcut to adjust brightness and volume.
