Virtual desktops in Windows help you stay organized by separating tasks across multiple workspaces.

#### Adding a Virtual Desktop
Open Task View (Windows Key + Tab) and click New desktop, or use Windows Key + Ctrl + D for a quick shortcut.

#### Switching Desktops
Navigate between desktops via Task View or use Windows Key + Ctrl + Left/Right Arrow. While you can create unlimited desktops, switching is sequential, as Task View only displays nine at a time.

#### Why Use Virtual Desktops?
- ✅ Organize work and personal tasks
- ✅ Reduce clutter
- ✅ Improve focus and multitasking
